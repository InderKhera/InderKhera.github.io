After finishing my ungrad in Economics at Simon Fraster University I worked for the last 3 years in the finance sector for a Vancouver based investment firm.\nAlthough my career trajectory was going at a successful pace I always felt as if something was missing. Looking back after some self reflection I was able to realize I always enjoyed my Data Science courses the most while completeting my undergrad, and hoped to one day have a career in the field.\nI can now proudly say I am aport of the 9th cohort of UBC MDS and taking the steps needed to make my goals come true!\nTo learn more about Quarto websites visit https://quarto.org/docs/websites."
